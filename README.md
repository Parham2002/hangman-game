This is my hangman game in terminal project.

A word is randomly picked and turned to dashes for the player.
Their goal is to guess the word by typing in letters one by one
while keeping an eye on the amount of lives they have left.
Guessing all the letters in the word allows the user to win,
whereas running out of lives by entering wrong letters makes
the player lose the game.
After the game is finished the player can decide whether they
wish to try the game again or not. If yes, then they can decide
how many lives they would like to have.

For this project I have used tools and methods including but not
limited to: Java, classes, methods, arrays, getters/setters, scanners,
conditional statements, encapsulation, etc.

If I could improve this project I would:
1. add exceptions for wrong inputs submitted by the user
2. prevent user from typing in a revealed letter
3. add and pass some tests
4. make the code tidier/more efficient
5. add more comments
